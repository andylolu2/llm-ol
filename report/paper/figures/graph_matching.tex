        \caption{Highest scoring node matching from the Graph F1 metric between the ontology generated by \name (\textcolor{teal}{\textbf{teal}}) and the ground truth ontology (\textbf{black}). The matching between nodes is shown in \textcolor{red}{\textbf{red}}, where the opacity of the edge indicates the similarity score (weaker links are more transparent). Visually, the matching defines a clear alignment of the two graphs: from the centre to the left we have the Mathematics-related concepts; at the top right we have Biology-related concepts; and at the bottom right we have Economics-related concepts.}
