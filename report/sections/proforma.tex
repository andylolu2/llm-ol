\chapter*{Abstract}

Prior to recent progress, Ontology Learning (OL) has mostly been tackled with rule-based methods which scale poorly. Recent work demonstrated potential for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to several sub-tasks of OL. This project aims to extend this idea to build a complete system for OL by leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, bypassing the needs for specialist models and large training datasets. If successful, this approach, by the virtue of the generality of LLMs, will be applicable to corpuses other than Wikipedia with minimal re-training and modifications.
